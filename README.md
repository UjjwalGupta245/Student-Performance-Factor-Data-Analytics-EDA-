# Student-Performance-Factor-Data-Analytics-EDA

Welcome to my first project as I embark on my journey to become a data analyst! This project focuses on the analysis of student performance factors using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.

## About the Project

This project was completed using Python on Google Colab's Jupyter Notebook. It provided me with the opportunity to get hands-on experience with various data analysis libraries. Here's a brief overview of what I accomplished:

- **Google Colab**: Learned how to upload files and use Google Colab's powerful cloud-based environment.
- **Pandas**: Used the Pandas library to read CSV files, explore data, and get descriptive statistics.
- **NumPy**: Leveraged NumPy for efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pyplot**: Created various plots such as bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and box plots to visualize data and extract meaningful insights.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights and skills, including:

- How to **upload files** in Google Colab.
- Using **Pandas** to **read CSV files** and **explore** the dataset.
- Getting the **description** of data to understand its structure and content.
- Creating various **plots** (bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and box plots) to **visualize data** and gain insights.
- Extracting meaningful information from visualizations to support data-driven decisions.

## Conclusion

This project has been an incredible learning experience and has solidified my foundation in data analysis. I'm excited to continue this journey, learn more, and tackle even more challenging projects in the future.
