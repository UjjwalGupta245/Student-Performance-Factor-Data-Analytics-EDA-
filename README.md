# Student-Performance-Factor-Data-Analytics-EDA-
I am starting my journey as a data analyst; this is my first project. 
I completed this project using Google Colab.
Get to work with different libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pyplot.
I learned many things like how we can upload a file in Google Colab how we can use the pandas library to read the CSV file learn to get the description of the data, how to plot graphs like bars, histograms, heatmaps and box  how to get information from them.
